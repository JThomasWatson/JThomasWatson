Hi, I’m @JThomasWatson
I’m interested in statistics applications for oncology research. 
I’m currently an MS student in an Applied Statistics, Analytics, and Data Science Program.
I'm currently reading "Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis," 6th ed. by Johnson & Wichern, and "Data Mining for Business Analytics," by Shmueli, Bruce, Patel, Yahav, and Lichtendahl.
I’m looking to collaborate on public health or oncology-related research.
